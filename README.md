A "read-only" sudo

What is sudoro?                                                                                                                              
---------------                                                                                                                              
sudoro is a setuid program that provides a "read-only" root-shell.                                                                           
This means it won't be able modify the system state (in theory), for example,                                                                
it won't be able to write files, kill processes, change hostname, etc.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                             
It is provided as a convenience tool for admins, to ensure they do                                                                           
not shoot themselves in the foot while troubleshooting and is not tested                                                                     
as a security tool (though if you test it, let me know how that goes!).                                                                      
**TLDR: Use with caution!**                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                             
Example usage

"FAQ"
-----

- Does this drop capabilities?
Yes, except for `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH`, `CAP_NET_RAW`.

- Does it keep uid 0/ root?
Yes.

- Does it use namespaces ("container?!")?
Yes. mount, ipc, pid, uts, cgroup are unshared.

- Does it use seccomp ("sandbox?!")?
Yes, it use seccomp to protect against some additional things.

- Can I put this on a guest shell ssh-accessible to the internet and nothing bad will happen?
Absolu..err. That seems like a terrible idea, but I'd like to see how many stupid things I forgot that would let you in, so please go ahead, let me know how that goes! ;-)
