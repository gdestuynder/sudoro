A "read-only" sudo

What is sudoro?                                                                                                                              
---------------                                                                                                                              
sudoro is a setuid program that provides a "read-only" root-shell.                                                                           
This means it won't be able modify the system state (in theory), for example,                                                                
it won't be able to write files, kill processes, change hostname, etc.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                             
It is provided as a convenience tool for admins, to ensure they do                                                                           
not shoot themselves in the foot while troubleshooting and is not tested                                                                     
as a security tool (though if you test it, let me know how that goes!).

Example usage
